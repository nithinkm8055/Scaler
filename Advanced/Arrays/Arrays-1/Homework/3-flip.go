func Flip(A string) []int {
	// Question stmt
	// string with chars 0 and 1
	// In one operation, choose 2 indices L and R, l <= r, and flip characters
	// return l r pair that can maximise number of 1s in atmost single operation as an array

	// o/p indexing is one based
	// o/p should be lexicographically dominant

	// Solution Approach
	// longest substring with max 0s > max 1s
	//start and end index must be a 0

	// 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0

	return []int{}
